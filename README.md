All currently existing hacks are outdated so I made my own

## To use:
* Navigate to the Gravity game on Quizlet
* Press Ctrl + Shift + I to open the developer console
* Press the 'console' tab at the top
* Start the gravity game
* Paste the contents of 'hack.js' into the console and hit Enter

## Troubleshooting:
* No answer appearing in the input box:
  + Paste the script in the console again
  + Report error by commenting on the repository
